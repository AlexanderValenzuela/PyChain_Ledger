# Project Title - Pychain Ledger

## Introduction
As a fintech engineer at a large global bank, the primary objective of our decentralized finance team is to build a blockchain-based ledger system with a front end web interface.  This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.
